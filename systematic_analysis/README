This directory mainly merges data from various sources. Including TINT objects, AWS data, environmental data (ERA5), and lightning.

Workflow:

1) Process the level1b AURA radar data using ../jobs_*/tint_driver.sh. Requires some pre-processing of AWS data (../aws_restruct/)
2) Process ERA5 pressure level data on rt52 into convective diagnostics using https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis/tree/master/jobs/era5_wrfpython
3) Do clustering on a smaller set of 36 cases, based on environmental factors (../auto_case_driver/kmeans_and_cluster_eval.ipynb)
4) Run "merge_data" jobs, which merge the above mentioned datasets (merge_data_jobs/*/merge_data_generic.sh
5) Run get_scw_stats.sh - this summarises the files created by the above step for fast analysis
6) *.ipynb for analysis and plotting
