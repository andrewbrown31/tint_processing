Scripts and notbooks for analysis of 36 severe convective wind (SCW) cases in eastern Australia
Cases are selected objectively ("auto_cases"), see generate_case_list.ipynb

  -> barra_era5_compare.ipynb
  Compare environmental data between ERA5 and BARRA reanalysis for each case
  Environmental data generated by code in this repo: https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis
  
  -> cape_shear_radar_*.ipynb
  Make radar reflectivity plots for each SCW case
  
  -> cape_shear_values.ipynb
  Plot climatological distributions of low-level moisture and temperature lapse rates, and deep-layer winds. Compare with SCW cases. Climatological data is produced in this repo: https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis
  
  -> case_driver_*.sh
  PBS scripts to run a modified version of TINT for each SCW case. TINT is here: https://github.com/andrewbrown31/TINT
  
  -> composite_soundings.ipynb
  Plot sounding composites for 3 environmental clusters
  
  -> generate_case_list.ipynb
  Get the list of 36 SCW cases. This uses observational data analysed by this repo: https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis.
  
  -> kmeans_and_cluster_eval.ipynb
  Clustering analysis based on environmental diagnostics for each event + analysis of those clusters. Environmental diagnostics generated by code in this repo: https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis
  
  -> one_min_obs_2.ipynb
  Plot one-minute lightning + station data for each SCW event
  
  -> one_min_obs_save.ipynb
  Extract one-minute lightning + station data and save, for use in other notebooks (kmeans_and_cluster_eval.ipynb)
  
  -> pca.ipynb
  Experiments with PCA analysis
  
  -> radar_aws_locations.ipynb
  Plot a map of radar and weather station locations
  
  -> scw_cases_tint_stats.ipynb
  Analyse storm statistics for SCW events, from TINT output
  
  -> som.ipynb
  Experiments with SOM clustering
  
  -> synoptic_objective.ipynb
  Plot climatological distributions of upper-level geopoitential vorticity and wet-bulb temperature gradient. Compare with SCW cases. Climatological data is produced in synoptic_objective.py
  
  -> synoptic_objective.py
  Create climatological data for upper-level geopoitential vorticity and wet-bulb temperature gradient
  
  -> synoptic_objective.sh
  PBS script to run synoptic_objective.py
  
  -> synoptic_plot.ipynb
  Plot various fields at synoptic scale from reanalysis data, for each SCW event.
